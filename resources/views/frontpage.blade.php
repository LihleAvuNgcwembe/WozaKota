                <h3>A Taste You'll Never Forget</h3>
                <p>When our doors first opened in 2021, Woza Woza Kota Place was made with the goal
                    of giving as many young students around the Midrand area the
                    chance of being able to buy fresh kotas full of taste and that
                    will allow you to enjoy your day whether you going, already at or
                    coming back from school. Ceejay and his team come together every day
                    to provide the best service possible to the youth at the best possible
                    price for you to enjoy.</p>
